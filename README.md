If you have Python installed, you can install Jupyter using PIP:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

- **Required Libraries**: This notebook requires the following libraries:

  - pandas
  - numpy
  - XlsxWriter
  - ydata-profiling

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**: If the notebook is hosted in a version control system such as GitHub, provide instructions to clone the repository. For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BoPDA1607/DataGotTalent2023_TeamEcoByte.git
cd DataGotTalent2023_TeamEcoByte
```

2. **Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended): Create a virtual environment to isolate the package dependencies locally:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Inside the activated virtual environment, install the required libraries specified in a `requirements.txt` file (if provided):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: Run Jupyter Notebook and open the `.ipynb` file:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Once Jupyter Notebook is running, navigate to the `.ipynb` file in the browser and click on it to open the notebook.

5. **Running the Notebook**: Execute the cells in the notebook in sequence by pressing `Shift + Enter` on each cell or using the run button in the toolbar.
